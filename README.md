### AngularJS Starter App Providing User Management

***CAUTION: Sapling is in the very early stages of development. Things are likely
to change in ways that are not backwards compatible***

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) + [Brunch](http://brunch.io)

Client Features:
* User Account management
* User login
* User signup
* Coffeescript / Less / Sass / SCSS / Stylus automatically compiled on save
* auto-reload during development saves you from manually refreshing the page
* Javascript / CSS minification for production
* [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular) integration for unit tests
* Bootstrap integration with themes.

## Usage

Sapling is intended to be used with a backend, but comes with a basic NodeJS / Express server to get your started.
*Please visit the `backend` section for a complete list of backends.*

* `git clone https://github.com/scotch/sapling.git` to clone the **sapling** repository
* `cd sapling`
* `./scripts/init.sh` to install node packages
* `./scripts/development.sh` to compile javascript and css

### Development

#### Starting Sapling with Express

*`npm start`
Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
This will run the Brunch in the background

#### Testing

* `./scripts/test.sh` to run unit test with [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular)
* Open the browser you would like to test to [http://localhost:3334](http://localhost:3334)

Notes:

- If you would like to write your test in coffeescript run `./scripts/compile-tests.sh` in a separate window.
- Testacular will run tests on save. To insure that changes are saved be sure to have ``./script/development.sh` running in the console.
- To changed the target browsers modify your `/test/conf.js` file E.g. `browser = ["ChromeCanary", "Firefox"]`

##### End to end testing

WIP

### Production

* `./scripts/production.sh` to minify javascript and css files for production use.

### FAQ

### Common issues

`EMFILE` error
- EMFILE means there're too many open files. Brunch watches all your project files and it's usually a pretty big number. You can fix this error with setting max opened file count to bigger number with command ulimit -n <number> (ulimit -n 10000 should be enough).

                                  underscore will not automatically be compiled, they must be imported.

                                  may safely delete this directory.
